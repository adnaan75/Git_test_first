Submitted by: Mohammad Adnaan
Abstract:
Ferroelectric materials are now a class of emerging materials being used to design novel semiconductor devices. In an effort to miniaturize electronic devices ferroelectric materials has been scaled down to two dimensional limit. The paper covers a brief overview of two dimensional ferroelectric materials from their intrinsic mechanism to their application in electronic devices. Out of the 2D ferroelectric materials α-In2Se3 is the most promising one which has been recently used to demonstrate ferroelectric field effect transistor experimentally. An atomistic model of the α-In2Se3 based field effect transistor has been built and a modelling approach to quantify the transport characteristics of α-In2Se3 using QuantumATK software has been done. The software integrates density functional theory with non-equilibrium green’s function method to obtain device characteristics.  
1. Introduction:
With the miniaturization of electronic devices and increase of device density in accordance with the moor’s law the technology is facing various challenges to keep up its growth[1]. In this aspect, ferroelectric materials provide opportunities to overcome various fundamental limits through steep subthreshold sweep MOSFETs with negative capacitance effect to low power consumption due to the presence of their spontaneous electronic polarization[2, 3]. Ferroelectricity is the spontaneous electric polarization in material due to their non-centrosymmetric molecular structure which can be altered by application of external electric field. It was first discovered in 1920 from bulk crystals of Rochelle salt by Valasek[4]. Then in 1940s first phenomenological theory of ferroelectricity was developed by Ginzburg et al. based on Landau theory of second order phase transitions[5] and around 1950 ferroelectric thin film was first deposited. Ferroelectric thin films exhibit different phase transition characteristics compared to their bulk counterpart which has been explained by the transverse Ising model by taking into account the finite size effect of the thin film[6, 7]. Earlier ferroelectric thin films were mainly composed of perovskite oxides with a thickness ranging from 100 nm to several micrometers. It was found that the ferroelectricity of those thin films were not sustainable at lower thickness than that range due to strong depolarization field and surface reconstruction caused by the surface energy[8]. Therefore, it was believed that there exists a critical thickness below which ferroelectricity does not exist[9]. Later on in 2000, Blinov et al. observed ferroelectricity in two monolayers (approx. 1 nm thickness) of polyvinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) which was a breakthrough against critical thickness concept[10]. Since then, there has been an upsurge of theoretical studies along with experimental works which led to the discovery of ultrathin ferroelectric thin films like BaTiO3 (2.4 nm), PbTiO3 (1.2 nm) and BiFeO3(two unit cells)[11-13].
In the recent years there is a growing interest in two dimensional materials due to their unique properties like in plane confined charge and heat transport which can overcome the limitation of bulk 3D materials[14, 15]. After Novoselov et al. successfully exfoliated graphene from bulk graphite[16] a good number of 2D materials beyond graphene has been developed including transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitrides and organic materials[17-19]. The extraordinary properties of the 2D materials integrated with ferroelectricity can provide us new opportunities to be explored in the field of nanoelectronics. Though 2D ferroelectricity was observed experimentally in 2015 there are still challenges to observe stable and strong in plane and out of plane spontaneous polarization in 2D ferroelectric materials[20]. Theoretical works have already predicted many 2D materials with intrinsic ferroelectricity, such as MoS2, In¬2Se3, CuInP2S6 and MX(M=Ge, Sn; X=S, Se, Te) and other III-VI materials[20-22]. Besides manually functionalized 2D material like hydroxylized graphene, denoted as graphanol has been predicted to have high polarization[23]. Following the theoretical predictions ferroelectricity has been observed experimentally in α-In2Se3 and later on has been used as channel material to build ferroelectric field effect transistor [24, 25]. Ferroelectricity in 2D is an exciting phenomenon which can overcome the current technological limit faced by the traditional semiconductor devices and can have profound impacts in the field of heterostructure devices, field effect transistors, topological insulators and tunneling junctions. Besides, ferroelectric materials are suitable for nonvolatile memory devices due to their spontaneous polarization in absence external electric field. As a result 2D ferroelectric material will provide us the opportunity to design high density low power memory architecture.  In this article the current prospect of 2D ferroelectric materials and novel nanoelectronic devices based on those materials have been discussed. At first the intrinsic mechanism of switching and origin of ferroelectricity from materials perspective has been focused, then their application to devices are summarized. At the end using QuantumATK software a device model for two dimensional α-In2Se3 based ferroelectric field effect transistor has been built and an attempt to calculate its transport properties has been done[26].
2. Mechanism of ferroelectricity in two dimensional materials:
Ferroelectric materials require an asymmetric structure to sustain a stable electrical polarization in absence of an external electric field. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the existence of ferroelectricity in different 2D materials. Firstly, covalent bond reconstruction in the molecular structure is responsible for ferroelectric switching in two dimension whereas in 3D bulk materials small uniaxial atomic distortions occur without covalent bond breaking and forming. Theoretically the switching mechanism of α-In2Se3 has been demonstrated to follow this process as shown in figure 2.1. The molecular structure goes through several transitional states while polarization direction switching in α-In2Se3 which has been verified with density functional theory based simulation. The intercorrelation between in plane and out of plane polarization switching can also be explained in this mechanism. The existence of polarization at two preferred molecular configurations is due to their minimum energy stable structure being non-centrosymmetric. This kind of structure produces a net dipole moment due to differential charge density[27].

Secondly, interlayer translation in multilayer 2D materials could change the interlayer potential and drive the flow of electrons. 2D out of plane ferroelectricity existing in bilayer of BN, AlN, MoS2 is induced by interlayer translation[28]. As shown in the figure 2.2 the polarization of hexagonal boron nitride layers can be switched by interlayer translation of one bond length. Besides, there are other mechanisms like structure distortion, dipole locking, asymmetric spin exchange interactions which has been used to explain the existence ferroelectricity in two dimension[29-31]. However, in all mechanisms the existence of net dipole moment in the structure is the factor to consider.

3. Currently available two dimensional ferroelectric materials:
Due to the limitation in fabrication technology and weak ferroelectricity at low dimensions there exist a few experimental evidence of two dimensional ferroelectric materials. Out of them α-In2Se3, CuInP2S6, SnTe, MoTe2, WTe2 are the most prominent ones which have been reported in literature multiple times. α-In2Se3 is recognized as the most stable structure out of its five different allotropes. It consists of Se-In-Se-In-Se quintuple layer stacking on top each other. Ferroelectricity has been observed upto the quintuple monolayer of α-In2Se3[32]. In case of CuInP2S6 ferroelectricity has been observed upto 4 nm thick layer. The antialignment dipole largely reduces the depolarization field inside CuInP2S6 indicating its stability to ultrathin thickness[29]. In SnTe ferroelectricity was found to persist at one unit cell thickness at liquid helium temperature and at room temperature it persisted upto four unit cell thickness[33]. Transition metal dichalcogenides like MoTe2 and WTe2 share same kind of structure. The vertical displacement of tellurium atoms induced distorted trimerized structure causes spontaneous polarization in these structures[34].    
4. Ferroelectric devices based on 2D materials:
4.1 Ferroelectric MOSFET:
The typical application of 2D ferroelectric material is to use as the channel material of MOSFETs. But the fabrication of stable 2D ferroelectric material on top of insulator oxide surface has always been a challenging task since it requires a careful selection oxide with minimal lattice mismatch with ferroelectric material[35]. As a result, though there is theoretical speculation about a good number of 2D ferroelectric materials the experimental evidence is scarce. Experimentally, two dimensional ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is fabricated on top of 2D MoS2 with channel length

of 1µm[36]. The device shows hysteretic behavior but the ratio between on/off currents is much lower. Moreover, the hysteretic behavior shown in figure 4.1 is not that much prominent to be useful but it was a success to fabricate 2D ferroelectric material in the MOSFET channel.
Later on Si et. al.[25] has experimentally demonstrated ferroelectric MOSFET whose channel material solely consists of two dimensional ferroelectric α-In2Se3. The hysteretic property of α-In2Se3 is evident form the Id-Vgs curve shown in the figure 4.2 (c). The fabricated device shows a high large on/off ratio of 108 with a maximum current of 862 µA µm-1. The device has a channel length of 1 µm and channel thickness of 92.1 nm. The dielectric materials were 90 nm thick SiO2 or 15 nm thick HfO2¬. The devices with HfO2 requires a significantly lower power supply voltage. As technology goes on developing this device has a great prospect for low power high density memory applications.
4.2. Ferroelectric memory devices:
Ferroelectric materials sandwiched between two metal electrodes exhibit different I-V characteristic depending on the polarization direction, which can be exploited to store memory

bits. Ferroelectric tunnel junctions and multiferroic tunnel junctions are promising devices for memory technology. Use of 2D ferroelectric material in these devices will shrink their sizes and enhance the memory density per unit chip area. 2D ferroelectric SnTe surrounded by large band gap insulator (figure 4.3(a)) is used to fabricate tunneling junction based devices where the in plane polarization of the ferroelectric material is exploited to switch the device from on state to off state and vice versa[33]. In case of SnTe it was not possible to get stable ferroelectric state at one-unit cell thick layer at room temperature. In fact, they can reach upto 270K temperature with stable ferroelectricity at this thickness but four unit cells thick layer can exhibit stable ferroelectric state at room temperature.

 On the other hand, α-In2Se3 with Au electrodes on both sides shows intercorrelated in plane and out of plane switching upon application of vertical electric filed[32]. Theoretical calculation shows that this unique in plane and out plane may originate from lateral movement of Se atoms (figure 4.4 (c)) in the molecular configuration[27]. This intercorrelated polarization switching is beneficial for memory devices because both horizontal or vertical electric field can be used to switch the polarization direction. Besides this device shows different I-V characteristics under different illumination conditions (figure 4.4 (d)) which is promising for storing more than two states of memory in the device.

4.3. Theoretically predicted devices:
Due to unique electronic transport properties van der waals heterostructure devices made of 2D layered materials are have drawn much attraction. External electric field is required to tune the transport properties of this layered structure. But in case of polarized layer the same property can be retained upon removal of external electric field due to the presence of spontaneous polarization electric field. Thus these kind of device can reduce leakage power loss significantly. Theoretically the potential of 2D ferroelectric heterostructures have been predicted by incorporating graphene or WSe2 layer along with In2Se3 layer as shown in figure 4.5 [27]. It is evident from the banddiagram of the figure 4.5(a) and (b) that under different polarization state the band gap of the system is quite different. So without the continuous application of external electric field the transport property of the structure can be maintained at a particular state indicting a significant amount of power loss reduction.

Two dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junction has been proposed where layered SnSe is used as in plane polarized ferroelectric material as shown in figure 4.6 [37]. The two electrodes are indium doped p-type semiconductor and Sb doped n-type semiconductor respectively. Using doped semiconductor as electrode material provides the opportunity to tune both the energy barrier height and width of the ferroelectric layer producing a giant tunneling electroresistance. The device density of states shown in figure 4.6 (b) shows the modulation of barrier width d1 and d2 depending on polarization direction.  These kind of device has prospect for miniaturization of tunneling memory devices with distinct on/off states.

Besides there are other types of devices like Rashba semiconductors spin FET where the spin orbit coupling at the interface of 2D GeTe/InP can be tuned by the ferroelectric polarization[38]. Moreover, 2D ferroelectric materials have additional advantages over traditional nonvolatile memory such as band tuning ability, miniature size in out of plane direction and low power consumption[35].
5. Simulation methods:
α-In2Se3 based ferroelectric field effect transistor has been demonstrated experimentally for the first time[25]. So α-In2Se3 has been chosen to build an atomistic field effect transistor to analyze the transport properties of this kind of device. The rhombohedral R3m crystal structure of α-In2Se3 has been obtained from reference [39]. An atomistic field effect transistor as shown in figure 6.1 has been built with this crystal structure in QuantumATK software[26]. Since increasing the number of atoms in the structure increases the computational time exponentially the device dimension is kept small. The channel length of the device is 6.48 nm and width is 0.68 nm with dielectric thickness of 0.8 nm. The dielectric is considered to HfO2 with dielectric constant 25. The device properties calculated in this way can be scaled up to compare those properties with devices of larger dimensions.
The software first solves the Kon-Sham device hamiltonian using LCAO (linear combination of atomic orbitals) basis sets within the framework of density functional theory to get electron density. Then total electron density matrix is split into left and right density matrix contributions. These contributions are calculated using NEGF (non-equilibrium green’s function method). On the other hand, self-energy of the electrodes is calculated from electrode hamiltonian. Then transmission coefficient of the device and other transport property is calculated from the device green’s function, electron density matrix and self-energy of the electrodes.  
In density functional theory simulation GGA-PBE functional has been used. for the atoms has been used. 81 k-points are considered in device transport direction along z-axis. Dirichlet boundary condition has been used at the edge of the transport direction and Neumann boundary condition along other direction has been used in the Poisson solver.
6. Results and analysis:

First, the transmission spectrum of the device from drain to source has been calculated for two different gate voltages. As seen from the figure 6.2 the transmission coefficient of the device has higher magnitude near the fermi energy level when gate voltage is 1V compared to that of -1V. It indicates that the conductivity of the device has increased when the gate voltage is positive. Then density of states of the device has been calculated for gate voltage of 1V and -1V which has been plotted in figure 6.2. From the density of states plot we can also observe its higher value at Vgs = 1V. As a result, in combination of transmission spectrum and density of states plot it can be

inferred that the device will be in on state for a positive voltage applied at the gate which is in accordance with the experimental result.  
Conclusion:
Experimental application of two dimensional ferroelectric materials are still at its infant stage. Theoretical analysis helps to figure out potential choice of materials to be fabricated and explored. It is quite difficult to get stable ferroelectricity in few unit cells dimension due to strong depolarization field but through continuous advances in manufacturing techniques incorporation of these materials in electronic devices will be possible in near future. Besides, there is huge scope to explore the underlying physics behind these materials including the effects of strain, interlayer interactions, edge effect in transport, multiferroic coupling, dopant and vacancy engineering. Analytical modelling and circuit level design of ferroelectric based novel electronic devices are also an unexplored area of research. With an increased number of two dimensional ferroelectric materials soon it will be possible to integrate them in computational electronic devices which will help to overcome the current technological limits in the field of semiconductor devices.
